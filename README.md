# YAGF
Yet Another GL Framework

MIT License except if file header states otherwise.

Dependencies:
* GLFW3
* GLEW
* Freetype 2

These dependencies are bundled with source file for VS build, you only need cmake.
Tested with VS 2013 on windows.

YOU NEED TO BUILD INSIDE A SUBFOLDER OF YAFG/ otherwise projects can't find
binaries/shader files at runtime.
